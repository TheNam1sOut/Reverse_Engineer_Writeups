# Reverse_Engineer_Writeups
A place where I will store all reverse engineering challenges I have managed to solve, including CTF challenges and sites like crackmes.one.

## Format of each challenge writeup
In each challenge's folder, the general structure of it will include:
1. The writeup itself, saved as writeup.md, it will be at the top of the challenge folder. The writeup will include the general information, as well as the link to the challenge itself
2. Pictures folder will include some screenshots I have attached to my writeup.md
3. Sources folder will include the challenge's given files
4. Scripts will include the script used to solve the challenge, if there is a need for one
